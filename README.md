# Trivia Paradise

## Overview

Trivia Paradise is an interactive, web-based quiz platform designed to test knowledge while providing an engaging user experience.

## Styling and Design 

The CSS used within the application blends vibrant color gradients in animated transitions. Along with that, the site also contains subtale UI details to enhance the overall user experience.

- Portions of the projected were supported with the use of **Claude AI**, which we used as a collaborative and learning tool througohut the design phase. We mainly leveraged **Claude AI** for: 
  - Protoyping the animation structures, such as the gradient backgrounds.
  - Suggesting layout approaches, espescially for the grid-based leaderboard, and form structure.
  - Contributed to reusable design variables, and responsive behaviors.

- All suggestions provided by **Claude AI** were subject to manual review and refinement. In particular, we enhanced and customized the output with:
  - Introducing original visual effects (e.g., animated buttons and responsive modals).
  - Contextual styling: modal positioning, leaderboard behavior, score display logic, and interactive transitions were all hand-tailored to match gameplay dynamics and narrative flow.
  - Design consistency and scaling: Colors were rebalanced for visual clarity and contrast, gradients were refined for smoother transitions, and spacing was tuned across all screen sizes for a uniform experience.

All styles are maintained within two main stylesheets:
- `choose_username.css`
- `start_quiz.css`
